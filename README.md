Excellent — using `uv` and `pyproject.toml` is a very modern and clean setup. That gives your project a great developer experience out of the gate.

Here’s how we’ll adapt the README to match your setup, while preserving the flavor and making it easy to onboard new contributors or curious nerds:

---

### ✅ Updated `README.md` (for `uv` users)

````markdown
# TerminalLifeform

**TerminalLifeform** is a terminal-native simulation about survival, entropy, and watching little digital lifeforms succeed (or fail).

**Entities live and die.**  
**Sometimes they thrive.**  
**Usually, they perish.**

## 🧬 Features

🔁 Terminal UI (with color, progress bars, status indicators)
🧬 Object-oriented and modular design
🌡 Entities, parameters, and behavior all easily customizable
🌈 Built using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and `pyproject.toml` 
⚙️ fast, modern Python tooling

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (blazing-fast Python package manager)

### Install & Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jtkIII/TerminalLifeform.git
cd TerminalLifeform

# Setup environment with uv
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or, if you're using pyproject.toml directly:
uv pip install -e .
# Then run
python src/main.py
````

## 🛠 Roadmap Ideas

* [ ] Entity evolution
* [ ] Save/load state
* [ ] Visualization or external UI (textual? curses? pygame?)
* [ ] Entity logging or journaling
* [x] Terminal-only chaos engine
